                    Although I was't exactly sure of what it was called, I have always wanted to study 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning#:~:text=Urban%20planning%2C%20also%20known%20as,of%20urban%20areas%2C%20such%20as"> 
                        Urban planning
                    </a>.
                    The first time I came to Addis Ababa to visit my relatives, I was fascinated by the city's huge size
                    and wondered how any one could ever have managed to plan every corner of this huge city. My uncle, who worked 
                    at the city's Municipality, told me that it was an Urban planner's responsibility. Ever since that moment, I have
                    dreamt of studying just that.
